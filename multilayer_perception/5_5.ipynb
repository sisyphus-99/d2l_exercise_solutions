While controlling model complexity is important to prevent overfitting, it’s not the sole determinant of good generalization. A model can be very complex and still generalize well if its complexity aligns with the patterns in the data."

    "Regularization techniques often involve controlling the complexity of the model to prevent it from fitting the noise in the training data too closely. Early stopping achieves a similar goal by monitoring the model’s performance on a validation set and stopping training when the performance starts to degrade. This helps prevent the model from overfitting the training data by limiting the number of training iterations."
